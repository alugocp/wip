        <h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          We are the Women in Physics group at the University of Maryland at College Park.
          We aim to provide a welcoming social environment for female members of the physics community at Maryland, as well as an opportunity to network and learn from each other about academic and career development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group is open to everyone -- undergraduates, grad students, postdocs, faculty and staff.
          Of course, this includes people of all genders.
          If you are interested in learning more about issues facing women in physics and in helping us build our community, we would love to meet you.

        <h1>Mentoring Program</h1>
        <p>
          Our mentoring program pairs undergraduate and graduate students to form supportive relationships.
          Matching is based on research interests and availability for meeting.
          Mentor/mentee matches are assigned for the school year, but they can last longer as good relationships form.
